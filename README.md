# Nightbird Engine

## A new Free and Open Source game engine.

Nightbird is a C++ game engine with Vulkan rendering and a dynamic project system.

Project code is compiled as a DLL which is loaded by the editor or game at runtime. Custom scene object classes are listed along with built-in types in the editor and can have custom functionality when added to the scene.
